patterns.py
 - Uses data files generated by __main__.py and draws cuantifiable data from them for use in the agorithm.
 
Machine-Learning+Guess+Algorithm.ipynb
 - A jupyter notebook documenting iterations of the guessing algorithm including changes, accuracy, and other stuff.
 
Guess Algorithm Versions
 - Full script for each version of the guess algorithm, just a modifiedpatterns.py.
 
graphing.py
 - Graphs accuracy by script run, meant to measure accuracy over time. (Seeing if accuracy increases with the number of avaliable lines).
